# Android-Blackjack

A Blackjack game I developed for Android. You can play it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burt-Wiley-Snyder-Blackjack-21/dp/B00JPVZ7C6/ref=sr_1_11?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1521410538&sr=1-11&keywords=blackjack">Amazon Kindle</a>
or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wileynet.blackjack">Google Play</a>.

I used the <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx">LibGDX</a> game engine and a Tween Library from <a href="https://github.com/AurelienRibon/universal-tween-engine">AurelienRibon</a>.

The graphics are mine. I used some standard graphics programs for that. I went for pure Native Java for better portability and less bugs. My goal at
the time was to get the game done as fast as possible and slap some ads on it. I never inteded to share it.
